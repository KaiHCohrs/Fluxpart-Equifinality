# Fluxpart-Equifinality
This project investigates the equifinality or robustness of the flux partitionings obtained from the approach using neural networks.
There are some relevant questions attached to this:
- How does the hybrid model affect the partitionings and their uncertainty?
- What effect do network specifics have on the outcome
- What effect does regularization have on the result
- When can we observe identifiable results?
